The chan_ss7 module implements SS7 connectivity for Asterisk. Major features
include

 - MTP2 (Q.703) implementation (mostly complete).
 - MTP3 (Q.704) implementation (bare essentials).
 - ISUP (Q.76x) implementation (reasonable subset).
 - Supports Digium E1 (T1 and other zap-compatible cards should be easy to
   add).
 - Supports incoming and outgoing calls.
 - Supports full ALAW audio (ULAW should be easy to add).
 - Facilities for raw MTP2 packet dump, suitable for Ethereal debugging.
 - Open Source (GPL).
 - Supports high call volumes; tested with 120 simultaneous calls, but
   should handle much more than that, depending on transcoding etc.
 - Supports multiple linksets with different DPCs
 - Supports linksets with multiple links.
 - Supports load sharing and MTP changeover.
 - Supports multiple hosts (cluster) configuration with load sharing and failover.
 - Flexible Dial command syntax for SS7 to allow use on linksets,
   e.g. Dial(SS7/linkset1/12345678)

New in version 0.9
- Major refactoring of source code to support other level 4 protocols
- Dynamic adjustment of audio data buffers during writes -
  this should reduce "write buffer full" problems
- New CLI command: ss7 show channels, same as ss7 linestat
- Initial address message can be broken to IAM and subsequent SAMs
- Fixed crash when executing CLI reset command
- Tested with asterisk version 1.2.9.

New in version 0.8.4
- Fixed crash when T1 expires
- Made check on audio read to detect underruns
- Fixed crash in process_acm
- Changed priority for continuity check thread
- Fixed crash in CLI command block/unblock
- Fixed CLI command output: "Unknown state: 3"
- Listen on cluster socket only when there are other cluster nodes configured
- Port for TCP connection in cluster now configurable
- Use of ast_setstate to report channel state changes
- New per link config options to enable echo cancellation in Zaptel driver
- New CIC hunting policies: sequential low-to-high and sequential high-to-low


New in version 0.8.3
- Fixed propagation of release causes to/from asterisk
- Reply with UEC when receiving messages from unknown peers
- Make t35 value configurable, and action upon timeout
  selectable (Timeout/End-of-pulsing)
- Redirecting number and redirection information are now
  included in IAM when present
- The optional backward call indicators allways has
 'In-band information indication'. If chan_ss7 has not detected
  any other source of in-band information, it generates it
- Enhanced dial command syntax: Dial(SS7/number:redirecting-number),
  allows a redirecting number to be inserted into IAM

New in version 0.8.2
- Handling of suspend/resume

New in version 0.8.1
- Introduced subservice configuration option for linksets.
- Fixed bug that causes crash when received CGU and other circuit group messages
- Fixed bug that causes repeat warning when doing continuity check
- Fixed a problem with the initial alignment procedure
- Tested with asterisk version 1.2.4.

New in version 0.8

- Multiple links with load sharing and MTP changeover
- Multiple linksets and multiple peers
- Multiple hosts (cluster) with failover capability
- Multiple interconnects (TCP/IP) between hosts for redundant communication links
- Additional supported ISUP messages
	- Circuit group unblocking
	- Circuit group unblocking acknowledge
	- Single circuit reset
	- Single circuit blocking
	- Single circuit unblocking
	- Continuity check request
	- Continuity
	- Subsequent address message
	- Sending of address complete message
	- Sending of answer message
- New UI ss7 commands: link status, linestat, cluster {start,stop,status}
- Partial support for continuity check
- Partial support for overlapped dialling (IAM, subsequent SAMs)

The configuration file format has changed, please refer to the different
ss7.conf.template.* example configuration files. It is designed such that
the same file can be used in a multi host setup.
