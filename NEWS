Specfication for version 2.1.0
 - Compatible with Asterisk 1.2.x, 1.4.x, 1.6.x., 1.8.x
 - MTP2 (Q.703) implementation
 - MTP3 (Q.704) implementation (subset).
 - ISUP (Q.76x) implementation (mostly complete).
 - Supports Dahdi/Zaptel compatible digital interfaces, e.g. Redfone, Sangoma, Digium, Openvox
 - Facilities for MTP2 packet protocol analysis using e.g. wireshark/ethereal
 - Supports high call volumes
 - Supports multiple linksets with different OPCs/DPCs
 - Supports linksets with multiple links.
 - Supports load sharing and MTP changeover.
 - Supports multiple hosts (cluster) configuration with load sharing and failover.
 - Flexible Dial command syntax for SS7 to allow routing to different linksets.


New in version 2.1.0
- Compatible with Asterisk 1.8.x (input from www.nethemba.com)

New in version 2.0.0
- Preliminary ANSI support.

New in version 1.4.3
- Handling of redirection info/number in REL.
- Support multiple linksets on one E1/T1.
- Fixes to mtp3d interface.
- Setting SS7_TMR variable on incoming calls, using SS7_TMR variable to set TMR on outgoing calls.
- Handling of redirection information in REL: SS7_RDNI, SS7_REDIR, SS7_REDIRECTCOUNT and PRIREDIRECTREASON.

New in version 1.4.2
- Minor fixes

New in version 1.4.1
- Fix for dial command CIC parsing.

New in version 1.4
- Support for linkset groups. The config option "group" for a linkset specifies which group a
  linkset belongs to. The dial command is extended to allow dialing to a linkset group, e.g.
  Dial(SS7/group1) where group1 may consist of multiple linksets.
- Handling/rejection of T.38 parameters.
- Dial command syntax extended. Dialing specific CIC is Dial(SS7/linkset:cic-range), e.g.
  Dial(SS7/linkset1:1-10/number) for dialing out on linkset1 on CICs 1-10, or Dial(SS7/linkset1:2/number)
  for dialing on CIC 2.
- Multiple DPC per linkset handling (Dutch ISUP).
- New config parameter for link: iftype, either E1 or T1.

New in version 1.3
- Support for multiple OPC (opc and dpc configuration settings now allowed in linkset section).
- Support of hardware/driver HDLC and FCS and MTP2 mode.
- New config parameter for link: stp, specifies STP point code.
- Handling of generic numbers in IAM
- Fixes for SCTP/IP
- Support for multiple signaling time slots on one E1 (schannel and sls config parameters)
- New config option for linkset: noa. Specify NOA for called party.

New in version 1.2.1
- Fix bug causing segmentation violation when using some cli commands

New in version 1.2
- Handling of UBA fixed.
- Compensation for problems with "resource temparily unavailable" when doing zaptel i/o.
- New config parameters for linkset: blockin and blockout. Sets initial blocking status for CICs.
- Hardware DTMF support (thanks to Sangoma).
- Dahdi and Asterisk 1.6.x support fixes.

New in version 1.1
- Fixed buffer overflows in config.c.
- Fixed loss of IDLE CICs.
- Fixed segmentation fault when using "combined" attribute for linksets.
- Fixed block/unblock of last cic not possible bug.
- Fixed handling of dial request supporting multiple audio formats.
- Support for STP signalling, see file ss7.conf.template.single-link for config.
- Jitter buffer handling (thanks to Martin Vít, sponsored by www.voipex.cz).
- H324M support (thanks to Klaus Darilion).
- Fixed a bug that could cause one-way audio in some cases where DTMF codes are sent.
- Fixed a bug where receive fifo is no longer being read.
- New configuration parameters for link, rxgain and txgain, specifies gain values.
- New configuration parameter for link, relaxdtmf, specifies whether to use relax dtmf.
- Fixed handling of timeout after received suspend message.
- Handling of Chinese SS7 variant: new variant config parameter for linksets (SS7 or CHINA)
  (Thanks to Lin Miao, lin.miao at domain openvox.cn).
- Fixes to SS7 variant handling.
- Fixed various mutex locking bugs
- The circuit group messages GRS, CGB and CGU are now substituted by a sequence of their
  single CIC counterpart when the configuration parameter grs is set to no for a linkset.
- Dahdi support (preliminary).
- Fixes to the non-group messages for GRS, CGB, CGU.
- FreeBSD support

New in verion 1.0.0
- Compatible with asterisk 1.2.x and 1.4.x.
- MTP stack placed in standalone executable.
- New loadshare config parameter for linksets (None, linkset, combined).
- New combined config parameter for linksets. Linksets having the same combined
  setting and having loadshare=combined share signalling channels.
- New auto_block config parameter for links. When set to yes, the CICs on that link
  are blocked when signalling on the link is lost.
- The schannel entry in link description in configuration file may specify remote MTP stack.
- PDU dump is now in PCAP format, suitable for wireshark.
- Lots and lots of clean ups and fixes.
