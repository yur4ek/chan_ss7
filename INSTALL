Build
-----
If asterisk is installed at the default location, just do

	make

It is possible to set the environment variable INCLUDE to specify
locations for Asterisk and Zaptel header files, and to set
INSTALL_PREFIX to specify a non-standard Asterisk installation root. For
example:

	INCLUDE="-I../zaptel -I../asterisk/include" make chan_ss7.so

The code is designed for Asterisk 1.2.x and 1.4.x.



Install
-------
Use 

	INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/asterisk make install

or just

	make install

if your asterisk is installed at the default location.

Alternatively, you can copy chan_ss7.so to the asterisk runtime module directory.

Create an ss7.conf (copy/paste/edit one of the ss7.conf.template.*
that best fits your needs). See additional information at

    http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/index.php?page=Asterisk+ss7+channels

Copy the ss7.conf to the asterisk runtime configuration directory,
this is by default located in /etc/asterisk, or
INSTALL_PREFIX/etc/asterisk.



Run
---

Issue

    load chan_ss7.so

in the Asterisk console. Read the file "ASTERISK_VARIABLES" to find out which
variables are read/set by chan_ss7.


Debugging
---------

chan_ss7 allows dumping of MTP2 packets into a capture 
file in pcap format (wireshark) using the 
    ss7 dump start /path/to/filename
command.

If you want "live" decoding you could dump into a FIFO 
file and use tshark to capture from the FIFO, e.g.:

  # mkfifo /tmp/mtp2fifo.pcap
  # asterisk -r
  > ss7 dump start /tmp/mtp2fifo.pcap
  > quit
  # tshark -V -i /tmp/mtp2fifo.pcap
